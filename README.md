Game Overview
In this game, you play as a team of four fighters trying to capture or defeat a hidden prisoner. The game consists of multiple rounds where both the fighters and the prisoner take turns performing actions. The game ends when the prisoner is either captured or defeated, or if all fighters are defeated.

Characters
Fighters: The fighters are a team of four characters with specific abilities. Each fighter has a certain amount of health, medkits for healing, a defibrillator for reviving fallen teammates, and potentially a thermal imager to detect the prisoner.

Prisoner: The prisoner is a hidden character with higher health and various abilities to attack, capture, or escape from the fighters. The prisoner can also break the fighters' detection items.

Game Mechanics
Fighters
Attack: Fighters can perform a basic attack, which deals a random amount of damage between 10 and 20.
Special Attack: Fighters can also perform a special attack, dealing a random amount of damage between 15 and 25.
Use Medkit: Fighters can use a medkit to heal 30 health points, but only if their health is below 40 and they have remaining medkits.
Use Defibrillator: Fighters can use a defibrillator to revive a fallen teammate with 50 health points. There is an 80% chance of success, and each fighter can use the defibrillator twice.
Use Thermal Imager: If a fighter has a thermal imager, they can use it to detect the prisoner. Each use consumes one charge, and the thermal imager has up to three charges per round.
Dodge: Fighters have a 30% chance to dodge the prisoner's instant kill attack.
Transfer Thermal Imager: Fighters can transfer the thermal imager to another teammate.
Prisoner
Attack: The prisoner can perform a basic attack, dealing a random amount of damage between 10 and 20.
Special Attack: The prisoner can perform a special attack, dealing a random amount of damage between 20 and 30.
Lethal Attack: The prisoner can perform a lethal attack, dealing a random amount of damage between 40 and 60.
Instant Kill: The prisoner has a 10% chance to instantly kill a fighter.
Emit Sound: The prisoner can emit a sound, which gives fighters a chance to dodge. If they don't dodge, they may get instantly killed.
Capture: The prisoner can capture a fighter, dealing 20 damage.
Break Detection Item: The prisoner has a 20% chance to break one of the fighters' detection items like the motion sensor, flashbang, or thermal imager.
Game Flow
Setup: The game starts with four fighters and one prisoner. Each fighter has 100 health points, 2-3 medkits, and one defibrillator with two uses.

Rounds: The game is divided into rounds. Each round, the following happens:

One random fighter is given the thermal imager for that round.
The prisoner may attack a random fighter or use other abilities like emitting sound or capturing a fighter.
Fighters take their turn to perform actions like attacking, using medkits, or using the thermal imager.
Actions: Each fighter and the prisoner can perform one action per round. Players can choose actions for the fighters interactively.

Detection and Capture:

If the prisoner is detected using the thermal imager or other means, fighters have a chance to capture or defeat the prisoner.
If fighters successfully capture the prisoner, they might receive additional items in the next round with a 70% chance.
If fighters defeat the prisoner, they might receive two additional defibrillators in the next round with a 20% chance.
Winning and Losing:

The game continues until either the prisoner is captured or defeated, or all fighters are defeated.
Fighters win if they capture or defeat the prisoner.
The prisoner wins if all fighters are defeated.
